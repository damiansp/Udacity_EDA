References used for this project:

Many searches in Stack Overflow (stackoverflow.com), and in the documentation for various R 
packages (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf, etc.).

I have had extensive education in statistics, and have made use of that in this project.  While I
cannot recall all of the materials I have learned from, I wish to especially reference two of the
most useful:

-Crawley, Michael J.  2005. Statistics: An Introduction Using R. Wiley.
-Faraway, Julian J. 2004. Linear Models with R. Taylor & Francis.
